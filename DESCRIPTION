Description: cbrATLAS is based on a the stand-alone program provided by Columbia 
    Basin Research (University of Washington) to analyze active tag mark-
    recapture studies.  The use of an active tag increases subsequent detection 
    probabilities but relies on a signal that may fail due to battery or 
    equipment failure.  Without adjusting for this probability, estimated 
    survival will be under-estimated.  Though reliant on having a tag-life study 
    from representative samples of tags used in the study, the method in this 
    program is a conservative correction.

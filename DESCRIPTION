Description: ATLAS is based on a the stand-alone program provided by Columbia 
    Basin Research (University of Washington) to analyze active tag mark-
    recapture studies.  The use of an active tag increases subsequent detetion 
    probabilities, but relies on a signal that may fail due to battery or 
    equipment failure.  Without adjusting for this probability, estimated 
    survival will be under-estimated.  Though reliant on having a tag-life study 
    from representative samples of tags used in the study, the method in this 
    program is a conservative correction.  See Townsend, R. L., J. R. Skalski, 
    P. Dillingham, and T. W. Steig. 2006. Correcting bias in survival estimation 
    resulting from tag failure in acoustic and radiotelemetry studies. Journal 
    of Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Statistics 11:183-196.
